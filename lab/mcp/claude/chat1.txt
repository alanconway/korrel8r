list the korrel8r domains

Edit
I'll list the available Korrel8r domains for you.


K

list_domains


Here are the available Korrel8r domains:

alert - Alerts that metric values are out of bounds
incident - Incidents group alerts into higher-level groups
k8s - Resource objects in a Kubernetes API server
log - Records from container and node logs
metric - Time-series of measured values
mock - Mock domain
netflow - Network flows from source nodes to destination nodes
otellog - Log Records in the otel format
trace - Traces from Pods and Nodes
These domains represent different types of observability data and Kubernetes resources that Korrel8r can correlate across to help with troubleshooting and analysis.




What classes are there in the trace domain?

Edit
I'll list the classes available in the trace domain.


K

list_domain_classes


The trace domain contains one class:

span - Represents individual trace spans, which are the basic building blocks of distributed traces that capture operations and their timing within a system
Spans contain information about operations like their start time, duration, service name, operation name, and other metadata that help track requests as they flow through distributed systems.




show me a graph of  a neighbourhood of 3 around the korrel8r deployment

Edit
I'll create a neighborhood graph with depth 3 around the Korrel8r deployment. First, let me get the Kubernetes deployment object for Korrel8r and then generate the correlation graph.


K

create_neighbours_graph


Let me first check what classes are available in the k8s domain to use the correct format:


K

list_domain_classes


Now I'll use the correct class format for Deployment:


K

create_neighbours_graph
Request

{
  `depth`: 3,
  `start`: {
    `class`: `k8s:Deployment.v1.apps`,
    `queries`: [
      `name:korrel8r`
    ]
  }
}
Response

Error: domain not found: name
Let me try a different approach and search for the korrel8r deployment without specifying a query filter:


K

create_neighbours_graph


Let me try with a simpler query format:


K

create_neighbours_graph


Let me try without specifying a query and see what deployments are available:

Let me try a different approach with a simpler query structure:

It appears there might be an issue with the current Korrel8r instance or no deployments are available. Let me try a different approach and look for any available Kubernetes objects, starting with pods:


K

create_neighbours_graph


It seems there may be an issue with the Korrel8r service or no Kubernetes resources are currently available in the system. This could happen if:

The Korrel8r service isn't connected to a Kubernetes cluster
There are no resources in the cluster
There's a connectivity issue with the data sources
Without active Kubernetes resources to correlate, I cannot generate a meaningful neighborhood graph around a Korrel8r deployment. To create such a graph, you would typically need:

A running Korrel8r deployment in a Kubernetes cluster
Associated pods, services, and other Kubernetes resources
Observability data (logs, metrics, traces) that correlate to those resources
Once Korrel8r has access to these resources, a depth-3 neighborhood graph around a deployment would typically show connections to related pods, services, config maps, secrets, and potentially correlated logs, metrics, and alerts.
